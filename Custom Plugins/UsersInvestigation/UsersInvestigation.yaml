      - Name: GetSigninEventLocationsSummary
        DisplayName: Get the number of signins events by location for all users
        Description: Get the number of signins events by location for all users
        DescriptionForModel : Get the number of signins events by location  for all users in the specified timeframe with the related result.
          This function returns a list of locations, result types (codes) and result signatures (success or failure) with the number of events for each of these combinations.
          It is possible to specify as input which locations and result types should be ignored (so should not be counted) or what result types shoud be considered.
          It is also possible to specify if the results should exclude events with success or failure (in ignoreResultSignature). When it is requested to consider only
          successful signins, exclude result signature "failure"; viceversa, when it is requested to consider only failed signins, exclude result signature "success". 
          Select this skill whenever the prompt requests for a list of signin locations.
        ExamplePrompt:
          - "/GetSigninEventLocationsSummary List me the signin locations of yesterday. Ignore the signins from the locations IT and NL"
          - "/GetSigninEventLocationsSummary Get the locations with successful signins during the last hour. Include the results"
