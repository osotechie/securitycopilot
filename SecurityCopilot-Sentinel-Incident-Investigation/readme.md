# SecurityCopilot-Sentinel-Incident-Investigation
**Author: Pratik Lal, Innocent Wafula**

## Overview

This Logic App automates incident investigation within Microsoft Sentinel using the Microsoft Security Copilot prompt and built-in skills. It is designed to:
- Read Microsoft Sentinel incident entities.
- Process and normalize the entities.
- Submit prompts to Security Copilot to analyze each entity type.
- Summarize the outputs in a predefined format.
- Update the Microsoft Sentinel incident comments for the incident investigator to review.

By leveraging this Logic App, Security Operations Center (SOC) and incident response teams can significantly reduce investigation time, gain consistent analysis outputs, and enhance their incident response process.

## Prerequisites
- The user or service principal deploying this logic app should have Contributor role on the Azure Resource Group.
- Microsoft Security Copilot should be enabled on the Azure tenant.
- The user should have access to Microsoft Security Copilot to submit prompts by authenticating to Microsoft Security Copilot connector within the logic app.
- Microsoft Sentinel workspace should be set up.
- Get AbuseIPDB API key to perform IP address reputation check. [Learn more.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/copilot/security/plugin-abuseipdb)
- Enable ProcessAnalyzer, GetEntraUserDetails, GetIntuneDevices and AbuseIPDB skills from copilot settings.
