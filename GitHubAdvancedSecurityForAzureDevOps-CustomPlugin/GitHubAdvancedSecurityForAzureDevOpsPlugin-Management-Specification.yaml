    title: GitHub Advanced Security for Azure DevOps - Alerts API
    description: Skills to retrieve Code Scanning, Dependabot Scanning and Secret Scanning alerts for the default (main) branch of
        the repositories (repos) of the projects stored in a specified Azure DevOps organization. 
        These scannings are executed by GitHub Advanced Security for Azure DevOps (a.k.a. GAzDO). 
        Despite its name suggesting a GitHub DevOps environment, GitHub Advanced Security for Azure DevOps is a security solution that 
        operates solely within Azure DevOps environments. It does not analyze code stored in GitHub repositories. The solution for GitHub 
        repositories is called “GitHub Advanced Security” or GhAS. DO NOT CONSIDER THESE SKILLS FOR PROMPTS RELATED TO GitHub REPOS.
        GitHub Advanced Security for Azure DevOps conducts secret scanning, dependency scanning (Dependabot, SCA), and code scanning 
        (via CodeQL, a SAST solution) in the Azure DevOps repositories where it is activated.
        GAzDO is billed monthly per "active committer". Committers are considered active if they have committed code to the repository 
        within the last 90 days.

paths:
    /_apis/management/enablement?api-version=7.2-preview.1:
        get: 
            operationId: ADO-Org-Enablement
            summary: Get the current status (configuration) of Advanced Security (GAzDO) for each repo of each project in the organization.
                This method returns configuration details for each repo of each project in the Azure DevOps organization. 
                Specifically, the output advSecEnabled specifies if Advanced Security (then CodeQL) is enabled. 
                Similarly, the output dependabotEnabled specifies if Dependabot (code analysis) is enabled.
